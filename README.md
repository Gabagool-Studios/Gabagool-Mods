# Gabagool-Gears
Gabagool Studios is a group of modders for Arma Reforger that aim to create a realistic representation of the 7th SFG, CAG, Rangers, and 160th SOAR through gear/uniforms, and weapons. On top of that we are also working on stuff for BLUFOR, INDFOR, OPFOR factions that will be used in JTF Grey Campaign Missions.
